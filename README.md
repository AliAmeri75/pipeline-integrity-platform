# ALIRIM

**Asset Lifecycle Intelligence for Risk & Integrity Management**

A unified Streamlit gateway for the Pipeline Integrity Research Platform,
developed from the doctoral research of Mohammadali Ameri with Yong Li at the
University of Alberta.

## Platform structure

├── Home and research overview
├── Fixed Inspection Scheduling

```

Each scientific application has its own GitHub repository and Streamlit
deployment. This repository provides a consistent introduction, documentation,
and same-tab launch links without duplicating the scientific models.

## Run locally

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

## Deploy

Deploy `streamlit_app.py` from the repository root on Streamlit Community Cloud.
No secret or large scientific dataset is required by this gateway. Each launch
page links to the corresponding independently deployed research application.

## Editable content

- [`content/PLATFORM_ABSTRACT.md`](content/PLATFORM_ABSTRACT.md) controls the
  short research overview on the home page.
- [`content/PUBLICATIONS.md`](content/PUBLICATIONS.md) controls selected journal
  and conference publications.
- [`content/DOCUMENTATION.md`](content/DOCUMENTATION.md) controls application
  links, documentation, and editing guidance.
